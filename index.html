                                <p class="excerpt">Otherworldly defines many things. In the case of Steve Johnson, the abstraction of shapes and colours on mixed media invites us to a beautiful world that normally exists only in dreams.  Steve grew up on the coast of Maine and was a big fan of Stephen King novels and New England folklore dating back hundreds of years.  In his latest series "Circular Ellipsis", he recounts to us a series of stories that inspired these paintings.  Read on to find out more.</p>

At a very young age, I wanted to be a marine biologist but also not forsaken my love for the arts.  Several decades later, I have become something of a nomad, and it has been a spectacular life out at sea.  Using a specialized camera I built with my good friend Paul Liverpool, we have been able to capture the beauty and grace of dolphins dancing in the sea.  </p>

Maybe it was the many Indiana Jones movies I watched as a kid, but to me, the desert is like nowhere else.  At age 25 and seeing this wild oasis for the first time, I trekked endlessly through the sand and discovered a secret that few have revealed.  No, I have not uncovered any hidden treasures.  Instead, this is something much better.  Much, much better.</p>

This route, which runs from Chicago to California connects the various facets of American life from as early as the 1920s.  Although this road has been decommissioned for decades, many still reminisce about a time in history that was simpler and woven with many hidden treasures about the American people.  Join me as I spend 12 days exploring the best of Route 66.</p>

                                <p class="excerpt">The northern lights always feel like an elusive and magical phenomenon of nature.  For me, I recalled seeing it in old Disney movies in the backdrop of pivotal scenes.  Was this magical light show real? I remember always asking myself.  Ever since then, I had a deep fascination with space and all things cosmic - spaceships, galaxies, and the many unexplored reaches of space that promise to remain hidden for years and years.  So, it is no surprise that I love chasing northern lights.  The first time I saw it in my life was outside our camp in the wilderness of the Canadian north.

                                <p class="excerpt">As a child, I grew up enjoying Sunday morning cartoons as my parents worked weekend jobs to support the family.  Contrary to what many think, I deeply treasured this alone time with my aunt.  To me, it was like a weekly getaway to my very own special place.  Sure, the cartoons themselves were fantastic with Mickey and Minnie and favourites like the Roadrunner.  But, quite honestly, these were the 10 years of my life that I would never forget.  Aunt May would always come pick me up on Saturday morning and take me straight to breakfast.  She lived by herself after her hushband dissappearing after World War II in Germany.  I would never understand what she felt from those tragic events, and yet, she was the person I felt the closest to through the many stories she shared with me.</p>

By the time I was in my teens, I had been to all the continents in the world and saw most of the great wonders of the world. Where then, could the teenage version of myself go after all that?  As it turns out, although I no longer need to travel everywhere, the spirit of adventure and lessons learned from overcoming challenges had become a large part of me.  I viewed the world in a more optimistic light, I became more open to opportunities, and I also learned to enjoy the company of strangers more.</p>
